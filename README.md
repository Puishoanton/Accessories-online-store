# Accessories-online-store

Welcome to my first pet project.
## Stack of technology: 
- React
- TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit 
- Firebase
- HTML, CSS(SCSS), JS
## What is it about? 
It is a small Internet store with its database.
On the website, you can register/log in, and look through all products such as protective cases for mobile phones, and wireless and wired headphones. Also, you can visit every product page where read the description of each item and add it to your favorite or basket. 
All products you can sort by name, price discounts, and popularity. (In future updates I will add more sorting.)
## Navigation
On this screen you can see all abilities of navigation on the website:
